# C-minus-Compiler
The compiler includes four main modules for lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and intermediate code generation.
The compiler is one-pass; the input program is read only once and the four main parts of the compiler work in a pipeline fashion.
The input to the compiler (through a file called 'input.txt') is a text file including a C-minus program, which has to be translated.
